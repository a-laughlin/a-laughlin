# GQDux

Simple, Redux-first GraphQL utilities optimized for developer speed.

- Leverage existing Redux knowledge, dev tools, and middleware  
- No Graphql server necessary. Use existing REST, RPC, Web Socket, and GraphQL server middleware.
- Flexible property partitioning - send only what each server needs
- constraints:
  - always creates a collection for objects, for a few reasons:
    - We often start with a single object, and need a list of them. Starting with a list is more flexible.
    - We can do anything with 1-length list that we can with a single object
    - Eliminating unnecessary decisions improves speed.


## Philosophy

Minimize AST Edges.
