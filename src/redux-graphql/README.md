# Redux-GraphQL

Simple, Redux-first GraphQL utilities optimized for developer speed.

- Leverage existing Redux knowledge, dev tools, and middleware  
- No Graphql server necessary. Use existing REST, RPC, Web Socket, and GraphQL server middleware.
- Flexible property partitioning - send only what each server needs

## Philosophy

Minimize AST Edges.
